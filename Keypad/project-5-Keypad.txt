--- Keypad:
-- It contains numbers and letters.
-- It has eight pins(four rows and four colomns).
-- In this project we have a keypad and LCD and we will show the data of the pressed buttons of keypad on the LCD.

--- How is keypad connected to microcontroller:
-- each row is connected to a pin in the mircrocontroller with a pull-up resistor and configured as an input.
-- each colomn is connected to a pin also but its configured as output pin.
-- how it works?
- the buttons are connected with columns and rows so if a button is clicked then its column will be 0V and its row will be 0V also.
