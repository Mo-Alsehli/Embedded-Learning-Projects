--- 7-segment:
-- In this project there will be a push button and a seven segment connected to the microcontroller and display the numbers when incremented when pressing the push button.
 __
|__|    --> This is a 7-segment 
|__|

-- It's a display that consists of 7 LEDs connected together used to display a number.
-- It has two types: Common Cathode (connect the led to the VCC) and Common Anode (connect the led to the GROUND).

--- BCD:
-- To use the 7-segment directly with the microcontroller, 8 pins will be used from the microcontroller to use only one 7-segment display.
-- This considered as a waste of resourses.
-- BCD chip has only 4 pins.
-- For each number to display the BCD decoder takes the number in binary and displays it on the 7-segment.
-- for example if we have the number 3 which is 0011 in binary it takes the binary number as input for the 4 pins and output a code to the 7-segment that will display the corresponding segments to display the number 3.

--- DBouncing Problem:
-- due to the high speed of the proccessor there might be a waste of executed time while the user inputing the data the processor may execute the code while the input isn't complete and lead to undefined behaviour and this is a waste. 
-- We can use a flag to solve this issue but it's not efficient in all cases.
-- We can use either a delay function.


--- 4LSB: the least significant bits are 0 1 2 3.
