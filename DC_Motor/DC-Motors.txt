--- Controlling a DC motor to rotate clock-wise or anti-clockwise.
-- The DC motors can't be directly connected to the mircorcontroller.
-- This due to the power usage of the DC motor which the microcontroller can't give.
-- A control circuit must be used to connect the microcontroller with the DC motor.
-- This circuit is called H_Bridge:

-- H-Bridge:
- It consists of 4-transistors.
- 2 are from PNP type and 2 are from NPN type.
- we connect them all parallel with the dc motor.
