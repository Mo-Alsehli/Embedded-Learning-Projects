--- LCDs:
-- They are used to display data.
-- They consist of 16 pins:
- PIN_1 - VCC (ground). 
- PIN_2 - VDD (+5v).
- PIN_3 - VE (contrast V) Controls the brightness of the LCDs.
- PIN_4, 5, 6 - Register select, Register read/write, Register enable.
- PIN_7 to PIN_14 - Data pins.
- PIN_15 - LED positive.
- PIN_16 - LED negative.

-- The LCD has 3 registers: DDRAM, CGRAM, CGROM.

--- 4-bit Mode:
-- When we are using the mode of 4-bit operation we will use the bits from 4 to 7 and the bits from 0 to 3 are not used.
-- Data is transfered twice before the instruction cycle is complete.
- The data is transfered to the higher order bits first which are from 4bit to 7 bit.
- Then the data is transfered to the lower order bits which are from 0bit to 3bit.
-- Charactrestics:
- N: referes to the number of lines.
- F: referes to the font size.
- D: referes to Display the value 0 means it's off.
- C: referes to the cursor the value 0 means it's off.
- B: referes to the Blink the value 0 means it's off. 

--- Initialization Process:
-- Wait for more than 30ms after VDD rises to 4.5V (we wait for the code is built and every thing is complete and we don't have to add a delay function).
-- Sending Commands:
-- We will send commands to initialize the LCD.
- we send the command to initialize the LCD and send a command to initialize the Enable register and set it to high.
- we will set the RS to LOW value which is the instruction Operation (now we are in the command mode).
- set the R/W in the writing mode (setting it to zero).
- then setting the value of 4MSP to the command hence the data pins will be connected to the 4MSP of the provided PORT.
- then we now set the Enable to High and wait for 5ms for ex and set it to low again.
- then we make a delay again as between each command we have to.
-- The initialize funciton it self:
- we will send the command of the function set(define values of N and F).
